# Now for the general description of what I got from all the videos

- NodeJs is what allows me to use various tools and additional features in VS Code  through extensions,
- These extentions allow me various things ranging from theming, red  squiggly lines for broken code, etc.
- Do not go about and instal a bunch of random extensions, otherwise its just going to be a hard to manage mess.

- Javascript is pre-written and ported into the code
- Don't know Javascript? That's what NPM is for. Goes straight to the `settings.json` file
- ESLint will help detect any issues in Javascript

- tbh half of everything I gathered from here made it occur to me that half of coding is seeing if there is pre-written code or various extensions that allow me to expand my work.
